## Purpose

#### What is Splunk Enterprise?
[Splunk Enterprise](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/software/splunk-enterprise.html) is a platform for operational intelligence. Our software lets you collect, analyze, and act upon the untapped value of big data that your technology infrastructure, security systems, and business applications generate. It gives you insights to drive operational performance and business results.

See [Splunk Products](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/software.html) for more information about the features and capabilities of Splunk products and how you can [bring them into your organization](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/enterprise-data-platform.html).

#### What is Docker-Splunk?
This is the official source code repository for building Docker images of Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Universal Forwarder. By introducing containerization, we can marry the ideals of infrastructure-as-code and declarative directives to manage and run Splunk Enterprise.

The provisioning of these containers is handled by the [Splunk-Ansible](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-ansible) project. Refer to the [Splunk-Ansible documentation](https://splunk.github.io/splunk-ansible/) and the [Ansible User Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/index.html) for more details.

## Quickstart

Start a single containerized instance of Splunk Enterprise with the command below, replacing `<password>` with a password string that conforms to the [Splunk Enterprise password requirements](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Security/Configurepasswordsinspecfile).
```bash
$ docker run -p 8000:8000 -e "SPLUNK_PASSWORD=<password>" \
             -e "SPLUNK_START_ARGS=--accept-license" \
             -it --name so1 splunk/splunk:latest
```

This command does the following:
1. Starts a Docker container using the `splunk/splunk:latest` image.
1. Names the container as `so1`.
1. Exposes a port mapping from the host's `8000` port to the container's `8000` port
1. Specifies a custom `SPLUNK_PASSWORD`.
1. Accepts the license agreement with `SPLUNK_START_ARGS=--accept-license`. This agreement must be explicitly accepted on every container or Splunk Enterprise doesn't start.

After the container starts up, you can access Splunk Web at <http://localhost:8000> with `admin:<password>`.

To view the logs from the container created above, run:
```bash
$ docker logs -f so1
```

To enter the container and run Splunk CLI commands, run:
```bash
# Defaults to the user "ansible"
docker exec -it so1 /bin/bash

# Run shell as the user "splunk"
docker exec -u splunk -it so1 bash
```

To enable TCP 10514 for listening, run:
```bash
docker exec -u splunk so1 /opt/splunk/bin/splunk add tcp 10514 \
    -sourcetype syslog -resolvehost true \
    -auth "admin:${SPLUNK_PASSWORD}"
```

To install an app, run:
```bash
docker exec -u splunk so1 /opt/splunk/bin/splunk install \
	/path/to/app.tar -auth "admin:${SPLUNK_PASSWORD}"

# Alternatively, apps can be installed at Docker run-time
docker run -e SPLUNK_APPS_URL=http://web/app.tgz ...
```

See [Deploy and run Splunk Enterprise inside a Docker container](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Installation/DeployandrunSplunkEnterpriseinsideDockercontainers) for more information.
