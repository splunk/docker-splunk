## 8.0.2.1

#### What's New?
* Releasing new images to support Splunk Enterprise maintenance patch.

#### docker-splunk changes:
* Bumping Splunk version. For details, see [Fixed issues](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.0.2/ReleaseNotes/Fixedissues) in 8.0.2.1.
* Bugfixes and additional tests for new features

#### splunk-ansible changes:
* Added support for reading `SPLUNK_PASSWORD` from a file
* License master and cluster master URLs are now also configurable in the `default.yml` config, as well as with the `LICENSE_MASTER_URL` and `CLUSTER_MASTER_URL` environment variables
* Added support for auto-detecting the `service_name` for SplunkForwarder and allowing manual configuration with `splunk.service_name`
* All HEC related variables were revised to follow a nested dict format in `default.yml`, i.e. `splunk.hec_enableSSL` is now `splunk.hec.ssl`. See the [Provision HEC](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-ansible/blob/develop/docs/EXAMPLES.md#provision-hec) example in the docs.

## 8.0.2

#### What's New?
* New Splunk Enterprise release of 8.0.2

#### docker-splunk changes:
* Bumping Splunk version. For details, see: https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.0.2/ReleaseNotes/Fixedissues
* Bugfixes and increasing test coverage for new features

#### splunk-ansible changes:
* Revised Splunk forwarding/receiving plays to optionally support SSL (see documentation on [securing data from forwarders](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Security/Aboutsecuringdatafromforwarders))
* Initial support for forwarder management using [Splunk Monitoring Console](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/DMC/DMCoverview)
* New environment variables exposed to control replication/search factor for clusters, key/value pairs written to `splunk-launch.conf`, and replacing default security key (pass4SymmKey)

**NOTE** Changes made to support new features may break backwards-compatibility with former versions of the `default.yml` schema. This was deemed necessary for maintainability and extensibility for these additional features requested by the community. While we do test and make an effort to support previous schemas, it is strongly advised to regenerate the `default.yml` if you plan on upgrading to this version.

**DEPRECATION WARNING** As mentioned in the changelog, the environment variables `SPLUNK_SHC_SECRET` and `SPLUNK_IDXC_SECRET` will now be replaced by `SPLUNK_SHC_PASS4SYMMKEY` and `SPLUNK_IDXC_PASS4SYMMKEY` respectively. Both are currently supported and will be mapped to the same setting now, but in the future we will likely remove both `SPLUNK_SHC_SECRET` and `SPLUNK_IDXC_SECRET`

* Bugfixes around forwarding and SHC-readiness
* Additional options to control SmartStore configuration
**NOTE** If you are currently using SmartStore, this change does break backwards-compatibility with former versions of the `default.yml` schema. This was necessary to expose the additional features asked for by the community. Please regenerate the `default.yml` if you plan on upgrading to this version.
